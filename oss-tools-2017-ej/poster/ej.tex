\begin{block}{What is Empujando Juntos}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Allow people to create online conversations to debate about any subject
    with a different paradigm that we call ``crowdsource``, which fosters
    more engagement than standard models like forum/thread

    \item People can to give their opinion by simple clicking in ``agree``,
    ``disagree`` or ``skip`` in other's comments

    \item Identify different groups of opinion based on the reactions of the
    participants in the comments using clustering algorithms.

    \item Uses Polis engine to calculate the groups. Every opinion is considered,
    majority and minority.

    \item Applying gamification concepts we invented the ``Push`` power. People in
    ownership of this ability are able to send direct messages and create events
    in the platform

    \item The ``Push`` is given to special actors in the groups formed by Polis.
    Three profiles are considered, the activist, the bridge and the consultation
    owner.

  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Why Empurrando Juntos?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We use the successful concept of conversation brought by Polis and extend it,
    allowing users to have an even more interaction with each other.

    \item  The ``Push`` power aims to foster the discussion between different
    groups of opinion, and increase the engagement of people in terms of social
    participation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Empujando Juntos Features}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mobile responsive and minimalist design on top of Polis embed iframe

    \item Hourly monitoring for Polis conversations created through the App
    to identify activists and bridge participants and give them the ``Push``
    resource

    \item Activists can open events and notify people in his group cluster

    \item Comments created by bridge people are spread to others through notifications

    \item Consultation owners have their content highlighted and they can open
    events that are notified to all other users
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\vfill

\begin{block}{System Architecture}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Front-end application, written in React Native\footnote{\url{facebook.github.io/react-native}}
    and a NodeJS\footnote{\url{nodejs.org/en}} server.

    \item The server module is responsible for managing users, ``the Push'', and
    to make the interface with Polis, which holds the conversation data and
    the clustering engine for finding groups of opinion
  \end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Current Status and Future Work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This is an ongoing research. Currently, we are preparing the first kiskadee
      release (v0.1), to perform analysis on C/C++ packages of the Debian
      GNU/Linux distribution using cppcheck, flawfinder and Frama-C.

    \item In the future, we want to extend kiskadee to monitor other software
      repositories, such as SourceForge and git repositories. We also want to
      improve the approach to handle persistent warnings (generated in previous
      versions) by assigning them a lower grade during the classification process
      instead of just omitting them.

    \item kiskadee development is open and can be found in \url{gitlab.com/kiskadee}.
